TRUE,Building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will take literally years.,rick-perry,Radio interview,"Meantime, engineering experts agree the wall would most likely take years to complete.

FALSE,Says John McCain has done nothing to help the vets.,donald-trump,comments on ABC's This Week.,"Trump said that McCain ""has done nothing to help the vets. ""While many veterans groups have had their differences with McCain over the years over specific legislation and his general approach to veterans issues, thats not the same as saying hes done ""nothing"" for veterans. In fact, just within the past two years, McCain has sponsored and helped enact several major provisions to help veterans. He also devotes a significant portion of his office staff to offer veterans on casework."
half-true,Suzanne Bonamici supports a plan that will cut choice for Medicare Advantage seniors.,rob-cornilles,a radio show,"But spending still goes up. In addition, many outside factors can affect the cost and range of benefits, making it impossible to know how Medicare Advantage might change. While the statement from Cornilles is partially accurate, it is taken out of context and ignores important details on a politically volatile subject."

Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporters question about whether he was at the center of a ""criminal scheme"" to evade campaign finance laws. In real life, the governor answered an emphatic ""no"" -- not surprising given hes been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation."
TRUE,Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees.,brendan-doherty,a campaign website,"Rhode Islands former top cop is setting his bar of expectation pretty high if hes promising to curb this kind of ""rampant fraud and waste.

TRUE,Says that Tennessee law requires that schools receive half of proceeds -- $31 million per year -- from a half-cent increase in the Shelby County sales tax.,stand-children-tennessee,in a post on Facebook.,"Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns. Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation. Our ruling    There is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters."
barely-true,"Says Vice President Joe Biden ""admits that the American people are being scammed"" with the economic stimulus package.",john-boehner,a press release.,"Boehner may be technically correct that Biden mentioned people being scammed in the roundtable meeting.

TRUE,Donald Trump is against marriage equality. He wants to go back.,sean-patrick-maloney,a speech at the Democratic National Convention,"Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Maloney said Trump is ""against marriage equality"" and ""wants to go back"" on the Supreme Courts same-sex marriage decision. Trump has consistently opposed same-sex marriage in interviews since 2000. He also said he would consider appointing justices to the Supreme Court who would favor reversing the decision and leave the issue of same-sex marriage to the states."

""Pence inaccurately described an Associated Press report. The report found that of 154 meetings Clinton took with private individuals over about half of her time as secretary of state, 85 were with people who had donated to the foundation. But the analysis leaves out thousands of meetings Clinton took, including every time she met with employees of both U. S.  and foreign governments. It also only covers part of her time as secretary of state."
barely-true,We know there are more Democrats in Georgia than Republicans. We know that for a fact.,mike-berlon,an article,"While more people voted Democrat in the 2008 primary, Republicans dominated in the 2010 statewide races, and more Georgians voted on the GOP ballot in July.

FALSE,"Says 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps.",facebook-posts,a meme on social media,"A social-media meme says that 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps. To get numbers that approximate this, the pie chart cherry-picks just discretionary spending. But that means the pie chart represents only about one-third of federal spending. Once you include the 60 percent of the budget that is mandatory spending, the military share plunges from 57 percent to 16 percent, and the categories that include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid collectively account for a majority of federal spending. Spending on food and agriculture is still small, but it does quadruple from 1 percent to 4 percent. Due to its skewed methodology, the pie chart offers a deeply distorted picture of federal spending."
half-true,On residency requirements for public workers,chris-abele,a letter,"He clearly has some misgivings about residency rules for Milwaukee County government, so leaving the file unsigned is not a major reversal. Still, his actions and words have been inconsistent, to the point where both his political friends and his frequent foes on the County Board were taken aback by his withdrawal from the fight as the legislative battle drew to a close in June. Indeed, if Abele had the nuanced position he says he did, it was so closely held that even one of his top aides apparently was completely unaware of it."
TRUE,Says the unemployment rate for college graduates is 4.4 percent and over 10 percent for noncollege-educated.,rick-santorum,a speech,"In October, it was 4. 4 percent, according to the BLS. In this category, the numbers havent changed much in the past 12 months. Santorums numbers were on target for college-educated workers.

half-true,A recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats say the biggest threat to our nations security is big government.,marsha-blackburn,a speech to the Freedom Summit in New Hampshire,"Blackburn said a recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans and 56 percent of Democrats ""say the biggest threat to our nation's security is big government. ""She got the numbers right, but the specific poll only offered respondents three options: ""big government,"" ""big business"" or ""big labor. Other polls, including Gallups own, show that when respondents are asked an open-ended question, other issues such as the economy rise to the top of the list. So Blackburn is essentially cherry-picking among polls."
TRUE,"Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care.",hillary-clinton,"a speech in Des Moines, Iowa.","It was granted a charter by Congress in 1863 and has a mandate to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. The report found that people without health care coverage:     received less frequent or no use of cancer screening tests;     received inconsistent care for the management of chronic disease;     received fewer diagnostic and treatment services for trauma or heart attacks, and had an increased risk of death when in the hospital.

""The report was independently reviewed."
FALSE,Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession than the current one.,sarah-palin,"her book, Going Rogue","The misery index in the current recession has been lower -- 5. 7 in 2008 and 11. 8 so far in 2009. The barometers we examined aren't necessarily equal measurements of the magnitude, but collectively they paint a picture that the current recession -- so far -- is worse than the one under Reagan. Even if we had decided to include inflation as a factor, the measurements would still indicate the current recession is worse."
mostly-true,There have not been any public safety issues in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.,chris-sgro,a speech urging Charlotte's anti-discrimination ordinance be left intact,"Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that ""There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities"" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. We havent found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. There was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U. S. , there have been a few yet-unproven allegations."
half-true,Says Mitt Romney was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse Marco Rubio.,marco-rubio,a prepared statement,"Rubio said that Romney was ""one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me. ""Romney did endorse Rubio before Crist dropped out of the primary in 2010. But it was clear at the time that Rubio would have thumped Crist in a primary if Crist hadnt dropped out. But it bears noting that Romneys endorsement of Rubio was something less than a pioneering stand."
pants-fire,The number of illegal immigrants could be 3 million. It could be 30 million.,donald-trump,"a speech in Phoenix, Ariz.","Trump said the number of illegal immigrants ""could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. ""Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million. The figure has ""always"" been 11 million, in recent years, because of the flow of undocumented immigrants in and out of the United States."
mostly-true,Marijuana is less toxic than alcohol.,marijuana-policy-project,a TV ad,"Our job as fact-checkers in this case is not to decide whether marijuana is good or harmful. We're focused on whether the drug in its natural form is ""less toxic"" than alcohol. In that regard, science and statistics present a strong case:  Deaths or even trips to the hospital are much more likely due to alcohol; Scientists could not find any documented deaths from smoking marijuana; A study found the safety ratio for marijuana (the number of doses to cause death) is much greater than compared to alcohol. Put another way, marijuana is 100 times less toxic than alcohol."
FALSE,Says Charlie Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme.,republican-party-florida,a TV ad,"The Republicans ad said, ""Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme,"" referring to Digital Domain getting $20 million in state incentives and then going belly up. But a state report, ordered by Scott, concluded there were no violations of law or rules by Crist or any other politician. The report also showed Crist was one of many political players who helped the company get the state money. A civil court could find that Digital Domain committed fraud. However, the companys plan to pay off its debt in another state by getting money from Florida doesnt meet the definition of a classic Ponzi scheme. Also, while Crist is mentioned in the court filing, he's not a defendant in the case."
TRUE,"Now, there was a time when someone like Scalia and Ginsburg got 95-plus votes.",lindsey-graham,a Senate hearing,"Reagan appointee Robert Bork, for example, lost a 42-58 Senate confirmation vote amid much partisan rancor in 1987. Obama was then a community organizer in Chicago. Here, though, we're checking if Graham was right that Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed by such large margins."
barely-true,I was gone when there was a red line against Syria.,hillary-clinton,the second presidential debate,"Clinton said, ""I was gone"" when there was a red line against Syria. Clinton was secretary of state in August 2012 when Obama said if the Assad regime were to use chemical weapons, that would cross a ""red line"" after which Obama would consider using military force in Syria. In the months following that statement, Clinton reiterated Obamas position, using the phrase ""red line. ""A year later, August 2013, the White House confirmed Syria had crossed this ""red line. ""By this point, Clinton had left the State Department months earlier. However, in the days following that revelation, Clinton met with Obama and his staff several times and publicly endorsed the White Houses position on how to respond."
half-true,"Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability.",republican-national-committee-republican,a blog post.,"As the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Kaine clearly is taking on college affordability by advocating debt-free college for everyone and tuition-free education for in-state students from families making less than $125,000 a year. When Kaine was governor from 2006 to 2010, in-state tuition and instructional fees rose 31. 2 percent at four-year colleges and 24. 5 percent at community colleges. Colleges largely are autonomous in Virginia and allowed to set their own student costs. Tuition has been rising steadily in Virginia and across the nation for decades. While Kaine did not pull the lever for the tuition hikes, they did occur under his watch."
TRUE,"Contends that President Obama literally said (if) his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, necessarily skyrocket.",mike-pence,MSNBC interview.,"Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget. Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340."
mostly-true,Active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts.,cliff-stearns,a press release,"However, that same research doesnt conclude that military members are twice as likely to ""develop"" prostate cancer as Stearns said. The study hypothesizes that one reason for the different diagnosis rate may be because military members are subject to more frequent health screenings. Getting to the bottom of the discrepancy is actually why Stearns requested the money. Thats a needed clarification when considering Stearns comment."
FALSE,Its been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee.,cory-gardner,a talk show,"While hemay have intendedto invoke the example of Supreme Court nominations in the 1888 presidential election-year, he didn't say that."
FALSE,"Under Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County D.A.s office convened the grand jury that indicted Rick Perry.",sarah-palin,a commentary,"Palin said that under Lehmberg, the ""Travis County D. A. s office"" convened the grand jury that indicted Perry. A special grand jury consisting of Travis County citizens indicted Perry in August 2014. But Lehmbergs office played no role in organizing the jurors. Early on, Lehmbergs office recused itself from handling the complaint that eventually resulted in the grand jury whose secret deliberations culminated in Perrys felony charges. A senior district judge from San Antonio, chosen by a judge based in Williamson County, impaneled the grand jury. The San Antonio judge picked a San Antonio lawyer to prosecute the case."
half-true,Tom Ganley has two Fs from the Better Business Bureau and over 160 complaints in just three years.,democratic-congressional-campaign-committee,an election ad,But the ad fails to note that those two grades later changed. Recognizing that Ganley is Ohio's largest car dealer with 20 dealerships is information not in the ad that lends it some perspective. And that the average grade for all those dealerships is a B plus is an important detail that also is missing.

barely-true,"Because of the federal health care law, 300,000 health plans canceled in Florida.",rick-scott,a television ad from Let's Get to Work,"Scott's TV ad says, ""300,000 health plans canceled,"" attributing the number to news reports. Last fall, Florida Blue started sending letters to 300,000 members stating that their plans didnt comply with Obamacare and would be canceled.

""The measure backed by Brown nine years ago made sure that women were provided photos of developing fetuses, along with a lot more information. It certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide this information to women seeking abortions -- except in cases of emergency -- and it ensured women received the information both through verbal questions and a signed consent form. Brown has a point that the bill wouldn't have ""forced"" them to look at color photographs -- but it did just about everything else it could possibly do up to that line."
TRUE,"The Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations.",dennis-kucinich,a television interview,"Two of the several foreign banks getting help were Royal Bank of Scotland Plc at $84. 5 billion and UBS AG of Switzerland at $77. 2 billion. The Federal Reserve treats foreign banks operating in the United States the same as U. S.  banks because they are all part of the same financial system. On a side note, even some companies, including General Electric, received emergency cash. So while Kucinichs comment that ""the Fed created $1. 2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks and some of them foreign banks so that they could stabilize their operations"" is a bit flip, maybe even pejorative, he was essentially correct in describing the unique money-creating capabilities of the Federal Reserve and how it was used."

""While thats a squishy figure -- an estimate that cant be pinned as a fact unless you somehow divine every Texans marginal tax rate for each of the 10 years, for starters -- it appears to be reasonable. Its also so that families that had these savings were mostly better off; lower-income taxpayers tend not to itemize deductions."
barely-true,Pre-existing conditions are covered under my (health care) plan.,mitt-romney,a presidential debate in Denver,"Romney said his health care proposals include protections for pre-existing conditions What he didnt say at the debate -- but which his website states and advisers confirmed after the debate -- is that people would be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured. The health care law, though, offers protections whether people have current coverage or not, so it offers more robust protection. The law also includes a requirement that everyone have insurance or pay a tax penalty. Romneys plan doesnt have that requirement. Romney did not mention the qualifier that people have to stay insured to get the protection."

pants-fire,Says he won the second debate with Hillary Clinton in a landslide in every poll.,donald-trump,a tweet,"For what theyre worth, those are landslide margins. But even in non-scientific surveys, Trump didnt win them all: In a non-scientific survey done online by the Fox television affiliate in Milwaukee, Clinton won by 52 percent to 48 percent among 325,000 votes cast. But four national, scientific surveys all showed that not only did Trump not win by a landslide margin, he didnt win any of the polls at all."
barely-true,Says bag litter increased after San Francisco banned single-use shopping bags.,drew-springer,a press release,"Springer said San Franciscos ""litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban"" on plastic bags. A litter audit conducted before the ban took full effect found two more retail plastic bags than the previous years sampling. However, the next audit, launched after the ban had been fully in place for nearly a year, saw a two-bag drop. Maybe this means that such litter is decreasing, though we would want more research to reach definitive conclusions."

And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for it.",michele-bachmann,"a Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa","In the 1993 interview, Gingrich advocated for individuals ""being required to have health insurance,"" though he expressed flexibility on the details. In the 2011 interview, Gingrich said ""we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond. ""Its an exaggeration to say that this equates to advocating for an individual mandate, since he posed it as one of two acceptable options."

""But Menendez fumbled by citing those specific figures. Over the first 10 years, the budget office is projecting a reduction of $210 billion, not the ""$250 million"" cited by Menendez.

half-true,"You said you would vote against the Patriot Act, then you came to the Senate, you voted for it.",hillary-clinton,"a debate in Manchester, N.H.","Clinton was also among those senators voting yes.

""This compromise does modestly improve the Patriot Act by strengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe,"" he said, adding, ""I urge my colleagues to continue working on ways to improve the civil liberties protections in the Patriot Act after it is reauthorized.

mostly-true,The federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan gave his first address to a joint session of Congress.,barack-obama,the State of the Union address,"Obama said, ""the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan"" gave his first State of the Union address. Obama's not far off, but its actually closer to 16 percent less. And using Reagan to make a case to raise the minimum wage should be taken with a grain of salt since the former president never increased it during his two terms. And by Reagans last State of the Union, the minimum wage was $2 less than when he first took office, if you factor in inflation. We had written that Obama had said ""the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan"" gave his first State of the Union address. As the reader pointed out, a new president's first address to a joint session of Congress -- the 1981 speech that Obama was referring to -- is not officially called a State of the Union address. So we have rewritten our paraphrase in the ruling statement above to remove the reference to the State of the Union."

""Hobby Lobby doesnt shun contraception entirely for its employees; it pays for access to 16 out of the FDAs 20 approved methods. Where Clinton has a partial point is that an employee would be barred from having the company pay for four other types, even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employees needs. UPDATE, July 4, 2014: After this article was published, Hillary Clinton's camp got back to us. A spokesman pointed us to a line from Ginsberg's dissent that ""seems to be pretty in line with"" Clinton's comments. ""The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga (Wood Specialties, another plaintiff in the case) would override significant interests of the corporations employees and covered dependents. It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure."
half-true,Says Charlie Crist voted against raising the minimum wage.,republican-party-florida,a campaign commercial,"The Republican Party of Florida said, ""Crist voted against raising the minimum wage. ""We should note that the vote in question was not the kind of vote people would usually think of when it comes to the minimum wage.

Crist was at the meeting, but none of the votes were recorded."

She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U. S.  communities have instituted for guns and the federal ""cash-for-clunkers"" program. She was ambiguous about how a U. S.  guns buyback program might be structured, saying ""I dont know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work.

""Already, a prototype driverless car has traveled more than 300,000 miles in the crowded maze of California streets without a single accident,"" Bush said. We dont fault Bush for citing the 300,000 figure rather than the recent 500,000 figure, because that higher number only received publicity after the CPAC speech. ""We found two accidents, but they both had mitigating factors. One car was rear ended, which suggests another driver was at fault. In another accident, a human was operating the car, at least according to Google. Still, we couldnt find one incident where a driverless car operating under its own technology clearly caused an accident."

And the most generous census estimate prior to last year indicates net migration from other states equaled 143,000 people from July 2008 to July 2009, accounting for less than a third of the states population increase in the period. However, looking at Texas population growth in terms of people moving here ""with their feet"" versus people born here, Dewhurst pegged the ratio correctly -- about half-and-half."

While scholars have found that in general, increases in the use of contraceptives lead to decreases in abortion, and one expert said Guttmacher may have underestimated its Georgia figures, we found no other study that confirms or refutes its conclusions about this state. Johnson would have been right if he said that studies show contraception decreases abortion, and that without Title X funds, abortions could rise."

barely-true,"If the sequester hits, federal prosecutors will have to let criminals go.",barack-obama,"a speech in Washington, D.C. ","Obama said that, if the sequester hits, ""federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go. ""Its clear that U. S.  Attorneys offices are looking at a potential cut of $101 million, and a reduction of that size would almost certainly cut back on prosecutions in some fashion. However, the impacts are not as clear-cut as Obamas bold language suggests. Officials will have a fair amount of discretion in prioritizing what types of cases prosecutors will pursue, possibly cutting back on civil cases rather than criminal ones. And the cuts taking place in U. S.  Attorney's offices wouldn't directly affect ""criminals"" at all, but rather suspects and targets of prosecution who haven't had their guilt determined yet."
barely-true,Says Dick Cheney de-Baathisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS.,chris-matthews,a broadcast on MSNBC,"Matthews said Cheney de-Baathisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS. We find that Cheney played a key role in de-Baathification and in creating the circumstances thatled to the formation of ISIS. Former Baathists provide important military ISIS leadership, as they did in the first few years after the invasion when they joined forces with the group that preceded ISIS, al-Qaida in Iraq. However, many of those same Baathists later turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. They shifted back into the orbit of what became ISIS due to the repressive policies under Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. The causal link is too distant to say Cheney created ISIS. His decisions contributed to the groups formation, but not more than that."
TRUE,Says Bill and Hillary Clinton attended Donald Trumps last wedding.,carlos-curbelo,a radio interview,"Curbelo said Bill and Hillary Clinton were at Donald Trump's last wedding.

FALSE,I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors.,steven-costantino,a statement,"In his defense, Costantino issued a statement in which he said: ""I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors. ""In other words: Dont blame me, I was just doing my job. But the records and comments of people involved illustrate that Costantino played a key part in Rhode Island's courtship of 38 Studios. The legislation he helped pass, offering valuable loan guarantees, was his idea, according to one former EDC official. During the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program. When the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman. Costantino played a pivotal role in creating the 38 Studios mess. In some ways, the record shows he bears as much responsibility as the other elected government officials who ""tasked"" him."
half-true,"Obamacare insurance cooperative failures should be expected because theyre like any business, and when you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed.",ezekiel-emanuel,"a discussion on MSNBC's ""Up with Steve Kornacki""","Emanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate thats typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureaus definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op. About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We wont know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the groups failure rate will be close to the national average. Emanuels statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details."
FALSE,The tax cut deal is giving $700 billion to millionaires and billionaires.,sherrod-brown,a CNN interview,"Yet by the time Brown appeared on CNN (three days after the administration announced the compromise), the deal was for two years, and it was that very deal that Brown went on the air to criticize. Even if the deal had been for 10 years, Brown misapplied the cost figure by describing the whole $700 billion as going to millionaires and billionaires. Joint Committee projections from earlier this year estimated that cost would be more like $327 billion over 10 years. Those are two key points on which Browns statement simply is not accurate."

Almost 13 percent of the nations hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage were in Texas, the second most-populous state with more than 25 million residents, or about 8 percent of the nations population, according to the U.

barely-true,"Any state tax law has to start in the House and the renewal of the state hospital bed tax this year started in the Senate, which is unconstitutional.",david-pennington,a public meeting,"The mayor and gubernatorial candidate is correct that tax laws must begin in the House of Representatives. But because the bill called for a state agency -- and not lawmakers -- to levy the fee, a legislative law opinion deemed the approval process acceptable. Also, challenges to the bills constitutionality would be difficult because the Georgia Supreme Court has not overturned legislation that has been duly passed by both houses and signed into law. Pennington and others may not agree with the process, or how the hospital levy is classified, but the law appears not to be on their side."

So both of the figures Pawlenty used have a basis in reality, but they do not relate to each other the way he suggested. If Pawlenty wants to stick with the $30,000-per-person figure, he should have said that debt stands at more than $9 trillion. Alternately, if he prefers to stick with the ""more than $13 trillion"" debt figure, he should say that the amount of debt per person exceeds $45,000."
